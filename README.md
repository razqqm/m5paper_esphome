# m5paper_esphome

**ESPHome Project for M5Paper**  
This project is designed to control the M5Paper display using ESPHome. It integrates functionality from several original projects and includes sensor integration, timers, and services for home automation.

---

## Features

- **ESPHome Integration:** Leverage the power of ESPHome to control your device.
- **M5Paper Display:** Operate an IT8951E-based display with customizable layouts.
- **Sensor Integration:** Built-in sensors for temperature, humidity, battery, UPS, and other diagnostic data.
- **BM8563 RTC Support:** Time synchronization via BM8563 (based on [TomG7363/esphome-BM8563](https://github.com/TomG7363/esphome-BM8563)).
- **Optional Touchscreen:** Possibility to control via a touchscreen (based on GT911).
- **Custom Settings:** Update intervals, layout, and fonts are configurable via YAML.
- **Screen Example:** The repository includes an example screen layout for visualizing data.

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress. All components are functional, but bugs and imperfections may still exist.

   - Place the `materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf` file into the `fonts` folder.

4. **Wi-Fi and OTA Configuration:**
   - Edit the `secrets.yaml` file to specify your Wi-Fi, OTA, and API key settings.

5. **Upload the configuration:**
   - Once configured, run ESPHome to upload the firmware to your device:
   
     ```bash
     esphome run m5paper_esphome.yaml
     ```
